# Gather Phase

Collect the code changes to review and determine the review scope.

## Base Branch Detection

**Important:** For code review, always diff against the **merge-base commit** (where the branch forked), not the tip of the base branch. This ensures the review only shows changes made on this branch, even if the base branch has moved forward.

Determine the base branch:
1. Check for the default branch (main/master)
2. If multiple candidate branches exist (feature-off-feature scenario), ask the user

Compute the merge-base:
```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base $BASE_BRANCH HEAD)
```

**Hint:** Lower commit count usually indicates the correct base branch. If `feature-b` was branched from `feature-a` which was branched from `main`:
- `feature-a` might show 24 commits
- `main` might show 142 commits (includes all of feature-a's work)
- The user should choose `feature-a` to review only feature-b's changes.

## Tasks

1. Identify the changes to review (branch diff)
2. Determine base branch and compute merge-base
3. Generate diff files for reviewers:
   - `full.diff` (git diff $MERGE_BASE..HEAD)
   - `commit-log.txt` (git log --oneline $MERGE_BASE..HEAD)
   - `commit-log-full.txt` (git log -p $MERGE_BASE..HEAD) for archaeology
   - `file-manifest.txt` with structured file list
   - Per-commit diffs in `per-commit/<hash>.diff`

## File Manifest Format

Tab-separated columns: status, adds, dels, path

Generate via:
```bash
git diff $MERGE_BASE..HEAD --numstat | while read adds dels path; do
  status=$(git diff --name-status $MERGE_BASE..HEAD -- "$path" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | cut -f1)
  echo -e "$status\t$adds\t$dels\t$path"
done
```

## Outputs

Write `review-scope.md` with:
- Branch being reviewed
- Base branch and merge-base commit
- Files changed with summary
- Context/purpose of changes

# Analyze Phase

# Generate PR Phase

Create a PR description from commit archaeology.

## Review Tour Generation

Create a top-down file tour clustered by purpose using the file manifest:

**Tier 1: Entry Points** - Where reviewers should start
**Tier 2: Core Changes** - The meat of the PR
**Tier 3: Supporting Changes** - Tests, configs, types
**Tier 4: Generated/Trivial** - Can skim or skip

## Commit Archaeology

Analyze the commit history to understand:
- The evolution of the changes
- Design decisions revealed by commit sequence
- Any course corrections or reverts

## PR Description Format

```markdown
## Summary

[1-3 sentences describing the change]

## Motivation

[Why this change is needed]

## Changes

[Bulleted list of key changes]

## Commits

[Summary of commit history]

## Review Tour

[File tour organized by tiers]

## Testing

[How this was tested]
```

## Outputs

Write `draft-pr.md` with the generated PR description.

Combine all perspectives into cohesive, actionable feedback.

## Inputs

- review-scope.md for context

## Code Feedback Synthesis

For each code review finding:
1. Triage as ACCEPT or DISCARD
2. For ACCEPT items, determine target commit for fixup
3. Handle reviewer disagreements explicitly

**ACCEPT criteria:**
- Bug or potential bug
- Security issue
- Significant maintainability concern
- Clear architectural violation

**DISCARD criteria:**
- Style preference without clear benefit
- Hypothetical concerns with low probability
- Already addressed elsewhere

## PR Feedback Synthesis

For PR review findings:
1. Categorize as ACCEPT or DISCARD
2. Apply accepted feedback to produce final PR description

## Outputs

Write to plan directory:

**code-recommendations.md:**
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Suggestions (should consider)
- Nits (minor style/preference)
- Positive observations (what's done well)
