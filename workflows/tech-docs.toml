# Research Phase

Gather information from multiple sources about the topic.

## Target Audience

Write for developers who:
- Know the programming language and framework basics
- Have not used this specific codebase before
- Will search for specific answers, not read front-to-back

Do NOT write for beginners, experts, or managers.

## Source Hierarchy (Code is Truth)

| Priority | Source | Role | Validation |
|----------|--------|------|------------|
| 1 | Current source code | Ground truth | None needed |
| 2 | Official documentation | Design intent | Verify against code |
| 3 | GitHub issues/PRs (recent, closed) | Historical context | Verify current state |
| 4 | GitHub issues/PRs (old, open) | Low confidence | Likely stale |
| 5 | External resources | Background | Always verify |

**Core principle:** If documentation contradicts code, code wins. Claims from sources 2-5 must be verified.

## Tasks

1. Explore the codebase for relevant code
2. Search for existing documentation
3. Check comments and docstrings
4. Look for examples and tests
5. Optionally search web for related concepts
6. Check GitHub PRs/issues for context (use `gh` CLI)

## Version Anchoring

Record the current git commit for version anchoring:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

This commit hash will appear in the generated documentation.

## Outputs

Write `research.md` with:
- Code locations and patterns found
- Existing documentation snippets
- Example usages
- External references
- Questions that need answers
- Git commit hash for version anchor

suggested_next = ["draft"]

[[phases]]

# Draft Phase

Create the initial documentation following strict guidelines.

## Inputs

Review research.md for gathered information.

## Document Structure

1. **Purpose** - One sentence
2. **Quick Start** - Minimal working example
3. **Examples** - 2-3 common patterns
4. **Details** - Deeper explanation
5. **See Also** - Cross-references

Skip empty sections.

## Example-Based Documentation Pattern

**Bad (exhaustive list):**
```markdown
## Hooks
Available hooks: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, PreCompact, SessionStart, Notification, SubagentStop, SubagentStart
```

**Good (example + search):**
```markdown
## Hooks

The SessionStart hook runs at conversation start:

```python
def session_start_hook():
    print("Session started")
```

To find all hooks, search for `hook_type` in hooks.py.
```

## Cross-Reference Guidelines

To source code:
```markdown
See [`src/parser.py:45-60`](../src/parser.py) for tokenization.
```

To related documentation:
```markdown
For configuration, see [config.md](./config.md).
```

To external resources:
```markdown
For regex syntax, see [Python re module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).
```

## Durable Documentation

Write documentation that survives code changes:

**Fragile:**
```markdown
The third argument controls buffering.
```

**Durable:**
```markdown
Pass `buffer_size` to control memory. Search for "buffer_size" in file_processor.py.
```

Principles:
- Reference by name, not position
- Include search terms for discovery
- Point to source for exhaustive details

## Negative Space Documentation

Document what the system does NOT do only when:
- A developer would reasonably assume it does
- The misconception leads to bugs or wasted debugging
- It's a deliberate design choice, not missing feature

**Good:** Note: The cache does not persist across restarts.
**Bad:** Note: This function does not make coffee.

## Version Anchoring

Include at top of generated documentation:
```markdown
---
generated_from_commit: [full SHA]
generated_date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
---
```

## Outputs

Write draft documentation file (e.g., `topic.md`):
- Overview/introduction
- Core concepts
- Usage examples
- API reference (if applicable)
- Troubleshooting/FAQ

[[phases]]

# Review Phase

Get comprehensive feedback on documentation quality.

## Tasks

Run these reviews in parallel:

### 1. Link Validation
Verify all source file links resolve:
- Extract all markdown links from draft
- Verify source file links exist
- Check line number references are valid
- Report broken links with suggested fixes

### 2. Slop Detection
Scan for AI-generated writing patterns using anti-slop guidelines.

**Forbidden Words:**
utilize, leverage, ensure, robust, comprehensive, streamlined, seamless, elegant, delve, navigate, showcase, facilitate, enhance, functionality, pivotal, tapestry, multifaceted, testament, underscore, realm, embark, unwavering, transformative, holistic, intricate

**Forbidden Phrases:**
- "In order to" → "to"
- "It's worth noting" → just say it
- "Furthermore", "Moreover" → new sentence
- "not only... but also..." → say both directly
- "In conclusion" → omit
- "Let's dive in" → omit
- "Let's get started" → omit

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- Em-dashes (—)
- Headers without content
- Rhetorical questions
- "In this section, we will explore..."
- "This code does X" → prefer "Code X"
- Lists > 7 items (link to source instead)

**Voice:**
- Active: "The parser reads" not "is read by"
- Short sentences
- Plain words: "use" not "utilize"

### 3. Gemini Editorial Review
Launch gemini-reviewer for content review:
- Evaluate document structure and navigation
- Check logical flow between sections
- Identify gaps (unanswered reader questions)
- Verify examples appear before explanations

### 4. Codex Accuracy Review
Launch codex-reviewer for technical accuracy:
- Verify code examples compile/parse
- Check function signatures match code
- Verify claimed behavior matches implementation
- Check configuration options exist
- Flag unverifiable claims

## Outputs

Write `review-feedback.md` with:
- Link validation results
- Slop detection findings
- Content feedback from gemini-reviewer
- Technical accuracy issues from codex-reviewer
- Suggestions for improvement

# Finalize Phase

Incorporate feedback and complete documentation.

## Inputs

- Draft documentation from draft phase
- review-feedback.md from review phase

## Feedback Synthesis

Categorize each finding as ACCEPT or DISCARD:

**ACCEPT (apply these):**
- Broken links
- Inaccuracies
- Missing critical info
- High-severity slop

**DISCARD (skip these):**
- Style preferences
- Short lists flagged as exhaustive
- Pedantic changes

Priority order: correctness > broken links > completeness > clarity > style

## Tasks

1. Apply all ACCEPT feedback items
2. Fix any broken links
3. Remove slop patterns
4. Verify version anchor is present
5. Add final polish

## Outputs

Final documentation ready for publication.

# Complete Phase

Finalize the documentation.

## Tasks

1. Final review of documentation
2. Verify formatting is consistent
3. Note where to publish/commit
4. Document any follow-up work

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] Version anchor present (commit hash + date)
- [ ] All links verified
- [ ] No slop patterns
- [ ] Examples before explanations
- [ ] Cross-references to source code
- [ ] Target audience appropriate

This is a terminal phase. The documentation is complete.
