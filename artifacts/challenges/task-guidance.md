# Challenges Reporting

If you encounter issues you **could not solve** during this task, write a `challenges.md` file in your task output directory.

## When to Write

- You couldn't figure out how to do something and used a workaround
- You hit a tool or library limitation you couldn't resolve
- You couldn't find documentation for something you needed
- You ran into an issue but had to move on without resolving it

## When to Skip

- Issues you **solved** (use proposals instead to document the solution)
- Normal debugging that you worked through successfully
- Expected complexity that was handled appropriately

## Format

Write `challenges.md` in your task output directory:

```markdown
## Challenge: <brief title>

**What was attempted**:
<what you tried to do>

**What went wrong**:
<the issue or limitation encountered>

**Workaround used**:
<how you worked around it, or "None - blocked" if you couldn't>

---

## Challenge: <second challenge if needed>
...
```
