# Selective Re-Review

If prior review feedback is injected above, this is a re-review round:

1. Read the prior feedback to identify which sources had **Critical** items
2. **Only re-engage reviewers whose Critical items remain unresolved**
3. Skip reviewers whose feedback was all addressed — carry their prior feedback forward unchanged
4. Instruct re-engaged reviewers to focus on whether their previously-flagged Critical items have been addressed
